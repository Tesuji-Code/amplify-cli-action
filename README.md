ðŸš€ :octocat: AWS Amplify CLI support for github actions. This action supports importing an existing auth in amplify through the `amplify import auth` command

You can include the action in your workflow as `Tesuji-Code/amplify-cli-action@master`. Example (configuring amplify, building and deploying):

```yaml
name: 'Amplify Deploy'
on: [push]

jobs:
  test:
    name: test amplify-cli-action
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [10.x]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1

    - name: use node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}

    - name: configure amplify
      uses: Tesuji-Code/amplify-cli-action@master
      with:
        amplify_command: import
        amplify_env: dev
      env:
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        AUTHCONFIG: ${{ secrets.AUTHCONFIG }}
        AWS_REGION: us-east-1

    - name: install, build and test
      run: |
        npm install
        # build and test
        # npm run build
        # npm run test
